# maternalhealthcardstz

## Hi ! this is my Final Year Project at the University Of Dar es Salaam

## About The Project

    Inaccessible maternal health data limits preparedness for birth complications like Eclampsia. Our solution is to digitize maternal health cards, using the data to develop a machine-learning model for predicting Eclampsia. This will enable data-driven decisions and solutions for doctors , researchers , innovators and patients themselves.
    
    We aim to ensure the solution is adopted by the ministry of health in Tanzania and being used in all hospitals , currently I am doing this project as my final year university project and its my hope the University will help me to scale the solution and assist me in tailoring it to actually meet the needs of Tanzanians.

##  Project Inspiration

    I admire the work done by multiple countries in Europe in digitizing their health care and would love to bring that in Tanzania , furthermore after doing research and seeing the potential it holds in improving the healthcare field in a broad way , gives me hope that the project will be a success.

The concept came about as I was doing self -learning on machine learning , and then an idea crossed my mind about how most hospitals fail to plan beforehand on birth complication issues that may arise during delivery and carter the needs of safe delivery , furthermore tracking mothers' recovery and child's growth. Diving deeper made me realize how digital data will be able to solve these issues , the sad thing was there we no available maternal digital health data to use in developing prediction models , which made to think on a way to transform physical cards to digital cards for researchers , doctors , patients and doctors to use data to improve healthcare in general. The solution is unique in a way that we are democratizing health data giving more power to the appropriate stakeholders to make decisive data-driven decisions , something which is novel in Tanzania.

## Social and Environmental Impact

How does your Project have a positive impact on society and/or the environment?

    The project stakeholders are:

        - Patients
        - Non-governmental Organisations
        - Nurses
        - Doctors
        - Ministry Of Health
        - Hospital facilities
        - Researchers

- The project aims to collect data and make the data available for innovators, researchers and health practitioners. It also helps the patients to get reliable services by planning ahead before delivery with limited resources available in the hospitals.
- The project doesn't need any raw materials it's software-based , which makes it sustainable and environmental friendly.
- The product life cycle adopts the agile development approach , where the software will undergo iterations to meet the needs and demands of the stakeholders.
- The project aligns with UN Sustainable Goals  **SDG3 #GoodHealth&WellBeing**

## Call to Action

- Too much time was spent on gathering user requirements and designing mockups to test how the end-users will interact , so as we don't spend too much cost in developing what's irrelevant.  It's my hope that when we get into development will be able to develop a solution that tends to the needs of the stakeholders.
- The journey on developing the product has been all about understanding the stakeholders and the problem present and for the question of feedback , I do believe they will be the best feedback providers through continuous research and product testing.
- Uncertainty remains on the national health data policy and how we can navigate to solve the problem with compliance to rules , laws and regulations pertain data privacy in Tanzania.
- I believe the iteration journey will be exciting since it will be based on iterating to meet the needs of the stakeholders and nothing else is as exciting as building a product that achieves market fit
